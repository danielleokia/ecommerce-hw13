## Description
The objective of this assignment was to create the backend for an ecommerce website that has functioning GET, POST, PUT and DELETE routes when the database is seeded using sample data. This involved setting up a database, designing the schema and creating web routes to connect the front-end to the back-end. The backend was tested to ensure that the routes were functioning correctly and that the data was being handled properly.  

Here is the link to the walkthrough video:
